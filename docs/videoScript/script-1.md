- javascript is cool
- javascript is everywhere
- javascript is hype!
- definitly hype.

- but javascript got issues, lets admit it
- one of them is strong typing.
- when you call a function with the wrong of argument, javascript tells you nothing.
- you are kept in the dark.

- "jsdoced javascript" has been designed to help on this issue.
- the principle is simple. we extract the information found in your jsdoc.
- and use it to check the arguments you pass to a function.
- so with jsdoced javascript, when you call a function with the wrong arguments
- you get warned immediatly.

- you better catch those bugs before your users see them, hey ? :)
